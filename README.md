# Water Week: Flowing Through St. Thomas

This website will be used for the "Water Week" event at the University of St. Thomas, where water and its unjustices will be explored in both religious and nonreligious aspects, and how we can fight water problems in many different ways. We explore the history of water on the St. Thomas Campus, the fight for water in Minnesota, the St. Thomas Sustainability plan and how water is involved in Dining Services, how water and Catholic Social Teaching come into play, and how anyone can find ways to fight for water in many different ways. All sources for information and help on the website is listed on the "Sources" tab on the Homepage.

The pages were written in Markdown, and the Github Pages theme (Cayman) uses Jekyll and HTML to format the subpages connected to one index page. To learn how to create a multi-page website, follow these instructions by Patrick Huston and Franton Lin on their website: https://phuston.github.io/patrickandfrantonarethebestninjas/howto
